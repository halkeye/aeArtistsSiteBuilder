Welcome to my art page!

I thought I'd give this a whirl and upload a big bunch of drawings that I've done over the years. 

I definately do need to start drawing again.

I'm Marie and I'll be putting my drawings for display and for sale at the Art Gallery at Anime Evolution 2009.

Hope to see you all there!

This is a wide range of all my favourite drawings. Enjoy!
