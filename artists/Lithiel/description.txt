Greetings, I am Lithiel, aka Kyla E. McNeilly. Graduated animator from BCIT, I'm an aspiring artist and film producer in the making. My company's name is Seilah Anima and we're currently working on the pitch for an independent film; which will be anime themed for a family audience. I'm currently working to hone my skills so I can support the weight of this project, and taking the time to focus more on the craft of the art of anime itself. Through a year of study I hope to gain the level of expertise required to pull off this investment in the near future. Wish me luck.
