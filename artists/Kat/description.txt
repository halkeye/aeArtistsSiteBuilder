Kat has loved to draw since she was little, but has focused on manga for the last 3 years.  Her favourite anime is Cardcaptor Sakura and her favourite manga is Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles; her artwork reflects that.  Her inspiration is music and she carries paper and pencil everywhere!   However she prefers to draw on the computer, using only the mouse.  Her second love is digital photography.
