About the artist:
Sara Antoine is a BC based illustrator.  She has training in graphic design and fine arts from TRU.  She's heavily influenced by, nature, richly illustrated fairy tales she read as a kid, martial arts flicks, older manga and anime and anybody who's really good with ink and watercolours because that's one thing she struggles with.

Her list of projects currently include a children's book of native legends, a podcast containing stories and interviews with native elders and her own graphic novel in progress titled Infamous Zen.

Also she really likes pie.
