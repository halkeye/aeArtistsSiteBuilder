Why puppy52?

I was told many years ago by a girlfriend that 52 looks like a heart shape on the pager. When it was time to decide on a domain name, puppylove, puppyluv, etc were already long taken up, so I decided to go with puppy52.
Currently puppy52.com leads to my Art gallery at puppy52art.com and Doll related blog, puppy52dolls.com.
